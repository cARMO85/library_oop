# Library OOP Project

## Overview
This repository contains a simple project designed to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. The core components of the project revolve around simulating a basic library system, where books can be added, checked out, or returned.

The project also showcases the use of multiple files in a Python project, effectively demonstrating how to modularize code and create a scalable project structure.

## Motivation
As a Data Science intern, I recognized the value of having a strong foundation in OOP and modular code organization. As I transition into working with databases at work, understanding the principles behind this project will prove invaluable.

By mastering the concepts illustrated here, I aim to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code in my professional endeavors, ensuring that I contribute effectively to my team and projects.

## Features
- **Book Class**: Represents a book with attributes such as title, author, and ISBN. It also manages the status of whether a book is checked out or not.
- **Library Class**: Acts as a collection of books. It offers functionalities like adding a book, checking out a book, and displaying available books.

## Future Plans
While this project serves as a foundation, I plan to integrate these OOP principles into more complex systems, especially as I delve deeper into database management and data manipulation tasks in my role.
